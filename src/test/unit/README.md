# Unit Tests

This directory will contain unit tests for individual components and functions.

Unit tests focus on testing a single unit of code in isolation, typically a function or a component.

## Structure

Tests should be organized to mirror the structure of the source code:

```
unit/
  components/
    Button.test.tsx
  utils/
    MkdSDK.test.ts
```

## To be implemented in the future
